To automate that, run this command

`echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`

run once

`source ~/.bashrc`

## Install several packages

    mkdir ~/catkin_ws
    cd ~/catkin_ws

initialize git and download this repository to ~ so that you would have ~/catkin_ws folder

    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/papillon-dgist/catkin_ws.git
    git checkout main
    git pull

# Errors

### If CMake Error occurs like:

`Assertion failed: file '/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/librt.so' does not exist.  Message: RT Library`

then try

`sudo nano /opt/ros/noetic/share/catkin/cmake/tools/rt.cmake`

and change

`if(NOT (APPLE OR WIN32 OR MINGW OR ANDROID)`

to

`if(NOT (APPLE OR WIN32 OR MINGW OR ANDROID OR UNIX)`

and recomile

### If CMake Error occurs like:

`Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robotis_manipulator" with any of the following names:`

then try installing rosdep install again with 

`rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src`

### If CMake Error occurs like:

`Project 'rh_p12_rn_a_gazebo' tried to find library 'pthread'.`

then try to downgrade CMake version. I downgraded cmake version from 3.16.3 to 3.13.2

    cd ~/Downloads
    wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.13/cmake-3.13.2.tar.gz
    tar xf cmake-3.13.2.tar.gz
    cd cmake-3.13.2
    ./bootstrap --prefix=$HOME/cmake-install

this process may take time. Then execute the following commands

    make
    make install
    export PATH=$HOME/cmake-install/bin:$PATH
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/cmake-install:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
    sudo apt install python3-catkin-pkg
    sudo apt install catkin

# Run

    roslaunch rh_p12_rn_a_manager rh_p12_rn_a_manager.launch
    rosrun rh_p12_rn_a_gui rh_p12_rn_a_gui
